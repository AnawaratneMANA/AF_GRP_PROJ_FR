The system accepts multiple user types. This also can be increased programmatically to fits the right requirement of the organization or the company. Predefine users are such as Admin, Researchers, Editors, Guest users. Reviewers. 

The site provides out-of-the-box functionality which also can be changed later to match the users’ exact requirements. 

Users can attach files, add event details, Subscribe to a conference event. In this application user management process is securely implemented using two-way authentication using JWT Auth tokens to provide a much more robust authentication platform for the users. 

Users will easily be able to see event details and forth-coming event details making sure that they will not miss anything. 

Upon subscribing to events users can also make registration payments using the in-built payment platform in the system. This provides payment managers a rich dashboard to keep track of every payment and person who does the payment.
